# COP290
# EDTool :
This repository holds the assignment allotted as a part of course COP290(design practices), IIT Delhi. It is used to make a 3D object from it's orthographic projections and projection of 3D object on a plane.

# Aim :
The package has following functionalities :
1. Able to interactively input or read from a file either i) an isometric drawing and a 3D object model or ii) projections on to any cross section.
2. Given the 3D model description we should be able to generate projections on to any cross section or cutting plane.
3. Given two or more projections we should be able to interactively recover the 3D description and produce an isometric drawing from any view direction.

# Organisation of the code :
The package structure for the software pckage is as follows :
